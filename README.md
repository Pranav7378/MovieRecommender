# MovieRecommender
This Movie Recommendation System suggests similar movies based on a selected title, using collaborative filtering. Built with Python, Streamlit, and TMDB API, it displays movie titles and posters. The system handles errors gracefully, showing placeholder images when posters are unavailable, ensuring a smooth user experience.
